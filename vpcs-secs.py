What You Need to Update:
	•	Replace:
	•	'<ACCOUNT_ID>', '<ACCOUNT_ID>' with your actual AWS account IDs
	•	'YourCrossAccountRoleName' with the name of the IAM role to assume in each account
	•	'tgw-attach-xxxxxxxx' with your Transit Gateway attachment ID

⸻

Output:

The script will print VPC IDs associated with the specified TGW attachment across accounts and regions.
